# explain hyper parameters meaning 
1. total_episodes

	•	Description: This is the number of episodes over which the agent will learn. An episode starts when the environment is reset and ends when a terminal state is reached or after a certain number of steps.
	•	Effect: More episodes give the agent more opportunities to explore the environment and refine its policy. However, beyond a certain point, additional episodes may not yield significant improvements and could lead to overfitting to the specific dynamics of the environment.

2. learning_rate (α)

	•	Description: This determines how much new information affects learned information. A value of 0 means the agent doesn’t learn anything, while a value of 1 means the agent only considers the most recent information.
	•	Effect: A higher learning rate allows the agent to quickly adjust to recent changes, but may cause it to forget older yet still relevant information. A lower learning rate makes learning more stable but slower, as it doesn’t significantly overwrite past knowledge with new data.

3. max_steps

	•	Description: The maximum number of steps the agent takes in an episode. If this limit is reached, the episode ends regardless of whether a terminal state has been reached.
	•	Effect: This parameter prevents episodes from running indefinitely and helps to estimate the agent’s performance within a fixed step budget. It encourages the agent to find more efficient solutions that maximize rewards within a given number of steps.

4. gamma (γ)

	•	Description: The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. It’s a value between 0 and 1.
	•	Effect: A value of 0 makes the agent shortsighted by only considering current rewards, while a value close to 1 makes it far-sighted by valuing future rewards more highly. High values help the agent to consider long-term gains from its actions, but may also make learning slower since it tries to optimize for the distant future.

5. epsilon

	•	Description: This controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Initially set to max_epsilon, it represents the probability of choosing a random action (exploration) over the best-known action (exploitation).
	•	Effect: Higher epsilon values encourage exploration of the environment, which is beneficial early in learning. Lower values favor exploitation of the known Q-values to maximize rewards based on current knowledge.

6. max_epsilon

	•	Description: The maximum exploration rate. This is the starting value of epsilon.
	•	Effect: Determines the initial amount of exploration. Starting with a high value allows the agent to explore widely at the beginning of training.

7. min_epsilon

	•	Description: The minimum exploration rate. This is the lowest value that epsilon can decay to over time.
	•	Effect: Ensures that there’s always some level of exploration, preventing the agent from becoming entirely exploitative and potentially getting stuck in suboptimal policies.

8. decay_rate

	•	Description: The rate at which epsilon is decreased after each episode.
	•	Effect: Controls how quickly the agent shifts from exploration to exploitation. A high decay rate reduces exploration rapidly, making the agent exploit its current knowledge sooner. A slow decay rate allows for more exploration over time, which can be beneficial in complex environments but may slow down the convergence to an optimal policy.

Adjusting hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a Q-learning agent. The optimal set of hyperparameters can vary depending on the specifics of the environment (e.g., the complexity of the state and action spaces, the dynamics of the environment, etc.). consider for each hyperparameter to potentially achieve better results, and why:

### 1. `learning_rate` (α)
- **Current Setting**: 0.5
- **Adjustment**: Consider experimenting with values closer to 0.1 or 0.2.
- **Reason**: A high learning rate can cause the agent to rapidly overwrite its Q-values, which can lead to instability and prevent convergence. A lower learning rate helps the agent to learn more gradually, potentially leading to more stable convergence on optimal or near-optimal policies.

### 2. `max_steps`
- **Current Setting**: 500
- **Adjustment**: Adjust based on the average length of episodes needed to solve the environment.
- **Reason**: If `max_steps` is too high, it might unnecessarily prolong episodes, especially in environments where the goal can be reached in fewer steps. This could slow down learning by focusing on less relevant parts of the state space. However, it needs to be sufficiently high to allow exploration of deeper states.

### 3. `gamma` (γ)
- **Current Setting**: 0.8
- **Adjustment**: Consider values closer to 0.9 or 0.95.
- **Reason**: The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. A higher `gamma` encourages the agent to consider long-term rewards more significantly, which can be beneficial in environments where future rewards are crucial for making optimal decisions. However, it should not be so high that the agent fails to prioritize immediate rewards appropriately.

### 4. `epsilon`, `max_epsilon`, and `min_epsilon`
- **Current Settings**: Starting at 1.0 and decaying to 0.01.
- **Adjustment**: Initial settings are reasonable, but you might consider a slower decay rate or a higher `min_epsilon`.
- **Reason**: Starting with high exploration (`epsilon = 1.0`) is good for ensuring the agent explores the state space thoroughly. However, decaying too quickly to `min_epsilon` might prevent sufficient exploration. A slower decay or slightly higher `min_epsilon` ensures that the agent continues to explore the environment even as it learns to exploit its growing knowledge.

### 5. `decay_rate`
- **Current Setting**: 0.005
- **Adjustment**: Consider decreasing to 0.001.
- **Reason**: A slower decay rate for `epsilon` ensures that the agent explores the environment more thoroughly over a larger number of episodes. This can be particularly useful in complex environments where the agent might benefit from exploring a wide range of states before settling into an exploitation phase.

### General Advice:

- **Experimentation Is Key**: The optimal hyperparameters can vary widely between environments. Systematic experimentation is crucial. Consider using techniques like grid search or random search to explore different combinations of hyperparameters.
- **Monitoring Performance**: Track the agent's performance (e.g., average rewards per episode) as you adjust hyperparameters to identify the best set for your specific environment.
