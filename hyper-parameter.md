# explain hyper parameters meaning 
1. total_episodes

	•	Description: This is the number of episodes over which the agent will learn. An episode starts when the environment is reset and ends when a terminal state is reached or after a certain number of steps.
	•	Effect: More episodes give the agent more opportunities to explore the environment and refine its policy. However, beyond a certain point, additional episodes may not yield significant improvements and could lead to overfitting to the specific dynamics of the environment.

2. learning_rate (α)

	•	Description: This determines how much new information affects learned information. A value of 0 means the agent doesn’t learn anything, while a value of 1 means the agent only considers the most recent information.
	•	Effect: A higher learning rate allows the agent to quickly adjust to recent changes, but may cause it to forget older yet still relevant information. A lower learning rate makes learning more stable but slower, as it doesn’t significantly overwrite past knowledge with new data.

3. max_steps

	•	Description: The maximum number of steps the agent takes in an episode. If this limit is reached, the episode ends regardless of whether a terminal state has been reached.
	•	Effect: This parameter prevents episodes from running indefinitely and helps to estimate the agent’s performance within a fixed step budget. It encourages the agent to find more efficient solutions that maximize rewards within a given number of steps.

4. gamma (γ)

	•	Description: The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. It’s a value between 0 and 1.
	•	Effect: A value of 0 makes the agent shortsighted by only considering current rewards, while a value close to 1 makes it far-sighted by valuing future rewards more highly. High values help the agent to consider long-term gains from its actions, but may also make learning slower since it tries to optimize for the distant future.

5. epsilon

	•	Description: This controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Initially set to max_epsilon, it represents the probability of choosing a random action (exploration) over the best-known action (exploitation).
	•	Effect: Higher epsilon values encourage exploration of the environment, which is beneficial early in learning. Lower values favor exploitation of the known Q-values to maximize rewards based on current knowledge.

6. max_epsilon

	•	Description: The maximum exploration rate. This is the starting value of epsilon.
	•	Effect: Determines the initial amount of exploration. Starting with a high value allows the agent to explore widely at the beginning of training.

7. min_epsilon

	•	Description: The minimum exploration rate. This is the lowest value that epsilon can decay to over time.
	•	Effect: Ensures that there’s always some level of exploration, preventing the agent from becoming entirely exploitative and potentially getting stuck in suboptimal policies.

8. decay_rate

	•	Description: The rate at which epsilon is decreased after each episode.
	•	Effect: Controls how quickly the agent shifts from exploration to exploitation. A high decay rate reduces exploration rapidly, making the agent exploit its current knowledge sooner. A slow decay rate allows for more exploration over time, which can be beneficial in complex environments but may slow down the convergence to an optimal policy.
