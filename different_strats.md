In reinforcement learning, there are several strategies and algorithms beyond the standard Q-learning with Bellman equation updates and ε-greedy action selection. These can be categorized into value-based methods, policy-based methods, and methods that combine both approaches. Here’s a brief overview:

### Value-Based Methods:

1. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: 
   - DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. It incorporates techniques like experience replay and target networks to stabilize training.

2. **Double DQN (DDQN)**:
   - This is an extension of DQN that reduces overestimation of Q-values by decoupling selection and evaluation of the action in the Q-update step.

3. **Dueling DQN**:
   - It has a neural network architecture that separately estimates state value and the advantage of each action, combining them to estimate Q-values.

4. **Prioritized Experience Replay**:
   - Modifies the DQN's experience replay mechanism to replay important transitions more frequently, improving learning efficiency.

### Policy-Based Methods:

1. **REINFORCE**:
   - A Monte Carlo policy gradient method which updates policies directly based on the cumulative reward.

2. **Actor-Critic Methods**:
   - These methods have two components: the actor, which updates the policy distribution, and the critic, which estimates the value function. 

3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
   - A policy gradient method that aims to take the biggest possible improvement step on a policy without causing performance collapse.

4. **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**:
   - It ensures that the updates to the policy are small to avoid drastic performance drops, enforcing a "trust region" in which the policy can be updated.

### Model-Based Methods:

1. **Dyna-Q**:
   - Combines Q-learning with a learned model of the environment to plan and learn more efficiently.

2. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
   - Used in combination with neural networks (as in AlphaGo), this method builds a search tree to evaluate the potential future outcomes of actions.

### Methods Combining Value-Based and Policy-Based Approaches:

1. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**:
   - An off-policy algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy in an entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework.

2. **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**:
   - An algorithm that uses a deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces.

### Exploration Strategies:

1. **Thompson Sampling**:
   - An alternative to ε-greedy where action selection is based on sampling from a posterior distribution of rewards, leading to a probability-matched exploration.

2. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:
   - Used in multi-armed bandit problems, this strategy selects actions based on both their estimated values and the uncertainty in those estimates.

3. **Noisy Networks**:
   - Networks that inject noise into the parameters of the neural network to drive exploration.

4. **Entropy-Based Exploration**:
   - Encourages exploration by adding an entropy bonus to the reward function, promoting diversity in the action distribution.

### Conclusion

Choosing an alternative strategy or algorithm often depends on the specific problem context, such as the size of the state and action spaces, whether the environment is deterministic or stochastic, and whether the action space is discrete or continuous. Each algorithm has its own strengths and is suited to different types of problems. Experimentation is key to finding the best approach for any given task.
